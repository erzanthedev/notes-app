# 📝 Notes App
---

## 📋 Overview

Welcome to the **Notes App** project! 📒

This project is a note-taking application that I developed by starting with a template of an existing codebase. I initially copied the codebase from Scrimba and re-built it using Create React App (CRA). The application includes various npm packages like `react-split`, `react-mde` as an editor, `showdown`, and `nanoid`.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to simulate real-world developer tasks, which often involve reading, understanding, and adding features to existing code. By starting with an existing template, I aimed to replicate the day-to-day responsibilities of a developer in a professional setting.

## 🚀 New Features Added

I enhanced the Notes App with the following features:

- **Sync Notes with Local Storage**: Ensures that notes persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
- **Add Note Summary Titles**: Provides a clear summary for each note, making it easier to manage and navigate through the list of notes.

- **Move Modified Notes to the Top**: Improves user experience by displaying the most recently modified notes at the top of the list.

- **Delete Notes**: Allows users to remove notes they no longer need, keeping their workspace organized.

- **Manage with Cloud Database (e.g., Firebase)**: Integrates cloud storage solutions for better scalability and accessibility.

## 🧑‍💻 React Skills in Practice

This project was also a great opportunity to reinforce my React skills by focusing on:

- 🛠️ **Reusable Custom Components**: Building modular components that can be reused across the project, making the code more maintainable.

- 🔍 **Mastering JSX Syntax**: Gaining a deeper understanding of JSX, which allows for the seamless integration of HTML and JavaScript.

- 🎨 **Organizing and Styling Components**: Structuring and styling components to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.

- 🔄 **Mapping Through Data**: Dynamically displaying notes by mapping through data arrays, making the application more interactive and functional.

- 💡 **Refactoring Code**: Passing props as objects using spread syntax, and restructuring code with conditional statements to improve readability and efficiency.

## 🧪 Testing My React Skills

The Notes App project was a comprehensive test of my React abilities, allowing me to:

- **Apply Core React Concepts**: From component creation to mastering JSX and state management, this project covered essential aspects of React development.
- **Improve Code Quality**: Through refactoring and applying advanced JavaScript techniques, I made the code more efficient and easier to maintain.

- **Simulate Real-World Scenarios**: By starting with an existing codebase and adding new features, I practiced the skills required to work in a professional development environment.
